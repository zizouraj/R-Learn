Notes on R
-----------
1.) It seems everthing in R is object just like other languages which I have worked on such as Javascript, C#, Java etc.

2.) R has five basic or "atomic" classes of object - what do I mean by this?
 -character
 -numeric
 -integer
 -complex
 -logical

3.) Here R can be compared with Javascript which too contains similar primitive objects, except for "complex" object.

R Datatype         Javascript Datatype
--------------------------------------
character           string
numeric             number
logical             boolean
integer
complex

Little bit more about primitive data types in R
-----------------------------------------------
Numbers - Numbers in R are generally treated as numeric objects (double precision real numbers- what do i mean by this)
Examples- 1 is number, 1L is an integer, Inf (Can be used in calculation!!), NaN.

4.) The most basic object of R is vector.  

5.) R objects can have attributes - Examples are names, dimnames, dimensions, class, length, etc.

Comparing R with other langs
----------------------------
Usually, in C# we create class and object is instantiated from the class. But somehow here, I find that objects are created
and it's class can be found out by class() function. Similar to typeof()
